mongoUtils
==========

| A toolcase with utilities for `mongoDB <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/>`__
  based mainly on `pymongo <http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/>`__
  useful also as mongoDB example usage and best practices.
| This library has been in developement as `pymongo_ext <https://github.com/nickmilon/pymongo_ext>`_ 
  until major changes in pymongo version 3 broke backward compatibility, it is now rewrittern from scratch.

:Usage:
   | See documentation of individual modules and classes
   | All examples require the existance of testing database and collections which are installed during execution of tests.
   | Also if mongoDB is not running on local host port 27017, testDbConStr connection string in configuration.py should be edited.  
   | Most examples require establishing a connection to testing database.
   
   >>> from pymongo import MongoClient;                        # import MongoClient
   >>> from mongoUtils.client import muClient                  # or alternativly this client
   >>> from mongoUtils.configuration import testDbConStr       # import conection string
   >>> client = muClient(testDbConStr)                         # establish a client connection
   >>> db = client.get_default_database()                      # get test database
